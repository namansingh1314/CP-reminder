            <h2>Why I Created This Reminder App</h2>
            <p>
                At CP Contest Reminder, our mission is to help you never miss out on important coding contests.
                We understand how easy it is to lose track of time amidst a busy schedule. Coding contests are excellent opportunities
                for practice, learning, and networking, and missing them can be frustrating.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why we built this reminder feature â€“ to send you timely notifications, ensuring you stay informed and prepared.
                With a simple subscription, you can receive reminders 2 hours before each contest, so you're always ready to participate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to make sure you never miss a chance to showcase your skills and engage with the coding community.
                Thank you for using our service and happy coding!
